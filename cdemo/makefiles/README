Makefile Examples
-----------------

Some examples of simple Makefiles for C programs.  To use:

  - copy the Makefile to the directory of your code and call it 'Makefile'
  - edit the Makefile to add your source files
  - type 'make'


Makefile1
---------

A super simple Makefile which requires the source files and target to be
added into the Makefile.  Will build only files which need building and
will also clean out the directory with a 'make clean'


Makefile2
---------

Similar to Makefile2 but this one automatically searches for .c and .h files in
the directory.  Just need to edit the target


Makefile3
---------

More advanced Makefile which will build C/C++/Assembly and take care of header
dependencies automatically.  Will also keep the source and object files seperate.
Probably an overkill for simple projects.
